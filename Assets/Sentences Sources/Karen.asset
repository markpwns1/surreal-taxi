  source: 'They''re scared. Karens recognize that if they faced consequences for
    their actions they wouldn''t survive. They recognize that people standing up
    to other Karens means their own Karen tactics may stop working.

    Of course
    this is all part of the basic package. They started down this path because they
    were something scare-adjacent at some point. Facing social conflict, disappointed
    to not get what they want, frightened in that way an infant is when the slightest
    thing goes wrong because they don''t know it''s not the end of the world. They
    tried aggression and it got the results they wanted. Better yet, they get to
    pretend they''re proactive. They''re not a maladjusted coward abusing others
    and indulging their own desires. They''re a crusader calling out the injustice
    (as they define it) and should be applauded because when everyone is treated
    like them (ignore the constraints of reality) then America will be Great again.

    The
    Karen worldview is constructed around them and people like them being right.
    It''s a conflict coping mechanism that''s prevented them from learning to process
    conflict any other way. Karens probably don''t know this consciously but their
    subconscious is screaming it.'
