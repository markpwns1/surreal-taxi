  source: "Hello, is this Pizza Hut?\r\n\r\nExcellent. My name is Ben Shapiro. Conservative
    thought leader. Prominent white YouTuber. The Muggsy Bogues of the intellectual
    dark Web. And\u2014look, it\u2019s just a fact\u2014I would like to order some
    pizza pie. If you are triggered by that request, I do not care. I truly do not.\r\n\r\nNow
    let\u2019s discuss conditions. First, thank you for agreeing to debate me. Typically,
    in fora such as this, I am met with ad-hominem mudslinging, anything from \u201CYou
    racist creep\u201D or \u201CIs that your real voice?\u201D to raucous schoolyard
    laughter and threats of the dreaded \u201Ctoilet swirly.\u201D However, your
    willingness to engage with me over the phone on the subject of pizza shows an
    intellectual fortitude and openness to dangerous ideas which reflects highly
    on your character. Huzzah, good sir. Huzzah.\r\n\r\nSecond, any pizza I order
    will be male. None of this \u201COur pizza identifies as trans-fluid-pan-poly\u201D\u2014no.
    Pizza is a boy. With a penis. It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s been true for
    all of human history, from Plato to Socrates to Mr. Mistoffelees, and any attempt
    to rewrite the pillars of Western thought will be met with a hearty \u201CFuh!\u201D
    by yours truly. And, trust me, that is not a fate you wish to meet.\r\n\r\nNow.
    With regard to my topping preference. I have eaten from your pizzeria in times
    past, and it must be said: your pepperoni is embarrassingly spicy. Frankly, it
    boggles the mind. I mean, what kind of drugs are you inhaling over there? Pot?!
    One bite of that stuff and I had to take a shower. So tread lightly when it comes
    to spice, my good man. You do not want to see me at my most epic. Like the great
    white hero of Zack Snyder\u2019s classic film \u201C300,\u201D I will kick you.\r\n\r\nOnions,
    peppers\u2014no, thank you. If I wanted veggies, I\u2019d go to a salad bar.
    I\u2019m not some sort of vegan, Cory Booker weirdo. And your efforts to Michelle
    Obama-ize the great American pizza pie are, frankly, hilarious. Though not as
    funny as the impressively named P\u2019Zone\u2014when I finally figured out that
    genuinely creative pun, I laughed until I cried and peed. A true Spartan admits
    defeat, and I must admit that, in this instance, your Hut humor slayed me, Dennis
    Miller style.\r\n\r\nAnd, with that, you have earned my order. Congratulations.
    Ahem. Without further ado, I would like your smallest child pizza, no sauce,
    extra cheese. Hello? Aha. A hang-up. Another triggered lib, bested by logic.
    Damn it. I\u2019m fucking starving.\r\n"
