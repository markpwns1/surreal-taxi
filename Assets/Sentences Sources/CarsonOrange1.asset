  source: "ok, so i'm walking down the street, right? and this dude comes out of
    nowhere! \r\nonce he has placed himself square in front of me, he yells \"oranges
    aren't fruit,\" and then starts running in place.\r\nobviously, i believe oranges
    are a fruit. i tell this moist panting man, \"oranges are my favourite fruit\".
    \r\nyou won't believe what happens next! he reaches into his coat pocket and
    whips out an orange.\r\ni stand in complete disbelief, because... y'know... what
    human being doesn't carry around spare oranges!\r\ni can't believe i had the
    audacity to say oranges are my favourite fruit, when i didn't even have any on
    my person.\r\nas i begin to beg and plead to this man, he says, \"this is why
    you carry oranges in ya coat pocket young fella,\" as he tosses one of his oranges
    towards me. \r\ni am no longer an orangeless man."
