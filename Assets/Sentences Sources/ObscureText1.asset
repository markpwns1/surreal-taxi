  source: "At first the girl in the Dauphine had insisted on keeping track of time,
    though for the engineer in the Peugeot 404 it no longer held any importance.
    Anyone could look at their watch, but it was as if this Time strapped to one\u2019s
    wrist or the bip bip of the radio were a measure of something else entirely,
    Time for those who hadn\u2019t been so stupid as to want to return to Paris via
    the southern highway on a Sunday afternoon, and, hardly having left Fontainebleu
    have had to slow down, stop, six lanes on each side (one is aware, of course,
    that on Sundays the motorway is exclusively reserved for those returning to the
    capital), put the engine in gear, advance three metres, stop, chat with the two
    nuns in the 2HP on the right, with the girl in the Dauphine on the left, take
    a look in the rear-view mirror at the pale man in the Caravelle, ironically envy
    the chirpy happiness of the young couple in the Peugeot 203 (behind the girl\u2019s
    Dauphine) that play with their little girl and make jokes and eat cheese, or
    bear the exasperated whining of the two lads in the Simca in front, and even
    clamber down and explore a bit without going too far (for one never knows when
    the cars ahead will recommence their forward march and one will have to rush
    back so as to avoid the war of car horns and insults from those behind), and
    so arrive at a Taunus in front of the girl\u2019s Dauphine who hasn\u2019t let
    up on checking her watch, and exchange a few droll, empty phrases with the two
    men who are travelling with a blonde child whose immense fun in these precise
    circumstances consists in running his toy car unhindered over the seats and the
    bodywork of the Taunus, or daringly advance a little more seeing as it doesn\u2019t
    seem as if the cars ahead are going to start off again, and contemplate somewhat
    pitifully the old couple in the Citro\xEBn ID that looks like an enormous purple
    bathtub with the two old fogies floating about inside, he resting his forearms
    on the steering wheel with an air of patient fatigue, she nibbling an apple with
    more application than desire.\r\nBy the fourth time of taking all this in, of
    doing all these things, the engineer had decided to stay put thereafter and wait
    for the police to clear the bottleneck in some way. The August heat was increasing
    and sticking to the tyres, making the delay all the more frustrating. The air
    was infused with the smell of gasoline, wild shouting from the young men in the
    Simca, the glint of sunlight reflected by the glass and chrome edges, and to
    top it all the contradictory feeling of being enclosed in a thick jungle of machines
    designed to run free. The engineer\u2019s 404 occupied the second lane on the
    right counting from the divider between the two motorways, leaving four more
    cars to his right and seven to the left, although only the eight cars that surrounded
    him and their occupants were clearly visible, and he had already tired of scrutinising
    them. He had already chatted with all of them, except the youngsters in the Simca,
    who he didn\u2019t take much of a fancy to; at intervals he had discussed the
    situation down to the last detail, and the general impression was that until
    Corbeil-Essonnes it would be a crawl, but that between Corbeil and Juvisy they
    would pick up speed once the helicopters and the motorcyclists had managed to
    clear up the worst of the bottleneck. No-one had any doubt that a very serious
    accident must have occurred in the area, the only explication for such an incredible
    hold-up. And with that, the government, the heat, taxes, traffic, one topic after
    another, three meters, another commonplace, five meters, a sententious comment
    or a muffled curse.\r\nThe two little nuns in the 2HP had best arrive in Milly-la-For\xEAt
    before eight since they were carrying a basket of vegetables for the cook. For
    the married couple in the Peugeot 203 the most important thing was not to miss
    their television program at nine-thirty; while the young girl in the Dauphine
    had told the engineer that she didn\u2019t mind if she got to Paris late but
    that she was complaining in principal as she considered it an outrage to treat
    thousands of people like a caravan of camels. In the last few hours (it must
    have been about five but the heat still harried them relentlessly) they had advanced
    some fifty meters according to the engineer, though one of the men in the Taunus
    who had come over for a chat, taking the child with the toy car by the hand,
    ironically pointed to a solitary plantain, and the girl in the Dauphine remembered
    that that plane tree (if it wasn\u2019t a horse chestnut) had been in line with
    her car for so long it was hardly worth looking at one\u2019s wristwatch any
    longer nor losing oneself in useless calculations."
