  source: "To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.
    The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics
    most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic
    outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy
    draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand
    this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths
    of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep
    about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots-
    of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial
    catchphrase \"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's
    Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those
    addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius
    unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. \U0001F602
    And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see
    it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're
    within 5 IQ points of my own beforehand."
