  source: "Leaving there and proceeding for three days toward the east, you reach
    Diomira, a city with sixty silver domes, bronze statues of all the gods, streets
    paved with lead, a crystal theater, a golden cock that crows each morning on
    a tower. All these beauties will already be familiar to the visitor, who has
    seen them also in other cities. But the special quality of this city for the
    man who arrives there on a September evening, when the days are growing shorter
    and the multicolored lamps are lighted all at once at the doors of the food stalls
    and from a terrace a woman's voice cries ooh!, is that he feels envy toward those
    who now believe they have once before lived an evening identical to this and
    who think they were happy, that time.\r\n\rThe ancients built Valdrada on the
    shores of a lake, with houses all verandas one above the other, and high streets
    whose railed parapets look out over the water. Thus the traveler, arriving, sees
    two cities: one erect above the lake, and the other reflected, upside down. Nothing
    exists or happens in the one Valdrada that the other Valdrada does not repeat,
    because the city was so constructed that its every point would be reflected in
    its mirror, and the Valdrada down in the water contains not only all the flutings
    and juttings of the facades that rise above the lake, but also the rooms' interiors
    with ceilings and floors, the perspective of the halls, the mirrors of the wardrobes.\r\n\rValdrada's
    inhabitants know that each of their actions is, at once, that action and its
    mirror-image, which possesses the special dignity of images, and this awareness
    prevents them from succumbing for a single moment to chance and forgetfulness.
    Even when lovers twist their naked bodies, skin against skin, seeking the position
    that will give one the most pleasure in the other, even when murderers plunge
    the knife into the black veins of the neck and more clotted blood pours out the
    more they press the blade that slips between the tendons, it is not so much their
    copulating or murdering that matters as the copulating or murdering of the images,
    limpid and cold in the mirror.\r\n\rAt times the mirror increases a thing's value,
    at times denies it. Not everything that seems valuable above the mirror maintains
    its force when mirrored. The twin cities are not equal, because nothing that
    exists or happens in Valdrada is symmetrical: every face and gesture is answered,
    from the mirror, by a face and gesture inverted, point by point. The two Valdradas
    live for each other, their eyes interlocked; but there is no love between them.\r\n\rIn
    Ersilia, to establish the relationships that sustain the city's life, the inhabitants
    stretch strings from the corners of the houses, white or black or gray or black-and-white
    according to whether they mark a relationship of blood, of trade, authority,
    agency. When the strings become so numerous that you can no longer pass among
    them, the inhabitants leave: the houses are dismantled; only the strings and
    their supports remain.\r\n\rFrom a mountainside, camping with their household
    goods, Ersilia's refugees look at the labyrinth of taut strings and poles that
    rise in the plain. That is the city of Ersilia still, and they are nothing.\r\n\rThey
    rebuild Ersilia elsewhere. They weave a similar pattern of strings which they
    would like to be more complex and at the same time more regular than the other.
    Then they abandon it and take themselves and their houses still farther away.\r\n\rThus,
    when traveling in the territory of Ersilia, you come upon the ruins of the abandoned
    cities, without the walls which do not last, without the bones of the dead which
    the wind rolls away: spiderwebs of intricate relationships seeking a form.\r\n"
