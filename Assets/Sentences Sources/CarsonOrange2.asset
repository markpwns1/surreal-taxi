  source: 'So, the other day, I was walking my dog.

    It was a beautiful summer
    day, when I started to notice something was incredibly uneasy.

    Whimsical
    air danced around my dog and I, but the immutable feeling of someone watching
    us persisted.

    As I drew near the local salvia shop, I noticed that a man
    was selling fruit out of his coat pocket.

    This man was none another than,
    Barney Smith. The man I met that fateful day... the day I did not have an orange
    in my cargo short''s pocket!

    Barney Smith, or BS for short, noticed my
    disconcerting stare, which seemingly left him perturbed.

    He shouted across
    the road, "Hey there, young whippersnapper! Ya got ya oranges?"

    I let out
    a small whimper, and started to run, opposite to his direction.

    The feeling
    of an old man''s sweat engulfed I and my dog. The rotten stench of his breath
    submerged us into a state of anguish.

    I felt a slight graze on my ear,
    BS was on top of us! He whispered in my ear, "Do ya got ya fuckin'' oranges?"

    I
    began to cry distraught tears. The pain of me, yet again, not having any oranges
    in my cargo pants had broken me beyond repair.

    How could I do this? Do
    this to them! To Barney...

    "No, sir," I mewled.

    He grabs my shoulder
    and puts me against the wall. We stand face-to-face, only inches apart.

    As
    he looks up and down, grazing his discoloured eyes across and around my body,
    he asks, "Well youngin'', why didn''t you just say so?"

    As he reaches into
    his coat pocket, I flinch. Only for him to reveal a pristine, and beautiful orange.

    Calmly,
    he says,"Here ya go, boyo. Next time, don''t forget."

    Slowly he backs away.
    Only to speedily gallop away, far from my sight.

    Now, I am alone. With
    the last being who cares for me. My dog.

    

    Anyways, at least I got
    a free orange!'
