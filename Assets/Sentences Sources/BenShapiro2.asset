  source: Alright mom, you think that the Lego Death Star is too expensive of a set
    for my birthday which hypothetically- hypothetically lets take a look at the
    facts (which don't care about your feelings) in a situation where, hypothetically,
    you get it for my birthday. So, we take a look at the numbers it's $499.99 but
    it has 4,016 pieces, and that means it comes down to a price point of about 12.4
    cents per piece and that's a fact, that's a fact (that doesn't care about your
    feelings). And even though that might be seemingly pricey in comparison to other
    lego sets, lets take a look at the minifigures. We have Han Solo in a Stormtrooper
    outfit, we have Luke Skywalker also in a Stormtrooper outfit, these are exclusives
    for the set since 2001. And it's a fact that you can recreate epic scenes- hypothetically,
    hypothetically, from A New Hope and Return of The Jedi if I had this set and
    I think the facts add up, that you should buy me this set (regardless of your
    feelings)
